Scenario#2
The restaurant would receive a fixed number of orders through out a day (8:00 am to 8:00 pm, 12 hours).
If the delivery time is more than 90 minutes, customer would cancel the order.
Profit = Total order revenue - number of the delivery man x 15(dollars/hour) x12 (hours)
Therefore, how many delivery man should be employed to reach the highest profit, and what is the
relationship between the profit and the success order rate.
