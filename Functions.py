"""
This module is our functions which are used in both scenarios.
For generating the map, we use networkx to create a grid and assume it to be the neighborhood, whose center
is the restaurant. Each node in the grid represents possible location of order and weight for each edge is
the time to travel.
Also, we consider weather influence. According to data from Champaign last year(2017), we calculate the
possibilities of rain,snow and too cold. With the possibilities, we will be able to add extra time to the
base deliver time because of the bad weather.
Moreover, we take the preparation time into consideration. We assume that there are three different types
of dishes and all apply to normal distribution.
