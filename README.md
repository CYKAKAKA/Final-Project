# Title: 
Simulation to estimate the delivery service time

## Team Member(s): 
Yekai Chen, Xiner Liu

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
This program aims to determine the total time cost for a delivery order which consists of food preparation and traffic time. The merchant and customer sit in the downleft and upright two edges of a square which maded from 4x4 smaller squares. For the traffic time, it would be affected by the weather and route choice. Using Monte Carlo can estimate the time cost for each section of route, the time impact of weather and the food preparation. After simulation, the esitmated food preparation time and optimistic traffic time would come up with the shortest delivery service time.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
- Traffic time for each route section of time
- Weather impact on traffic
- Food preparation time

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
- The delivery man will not go on the same road twice
- The traffic time obeys the beta distribution
- The food preparation time obeys the normal distribution
- The weather impact on traffic subjects to normal distribution

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
