# Title: 
Simulation to estimate the delivery service time

## Team Member(s): 
Yekai Chen, Xiner Liu

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
This program aims to determine the total time cost for a take-out delivery order which consists of food preparation time and traffic time. The merchant and customer sit in the downleft and upright two edges of a square which made from 4x4 smaller squares. For the traffic time, it would be affected by the weather and route choice. Using Monte Carlo can estimate the time cost for each section of route, the time impact by weather and the food preparation time. After simulation, the estimated food preparation time and optimistic traffic time would come to make the shortest delivery service time.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
- Traffic time for each route section of time
- Weather impact on traffic
- Food preparation time

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
- The delivery man will not go on the same road twice
- The traffic time obeys the beta distribution
- The food preparation time obeys the normal distribution
- The weather impact on traffic is related to the traffic time, if the normal traffic time is longer, the weather will influence more.
