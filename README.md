# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
For a resturant, it's increasingly necessary to have delivery service. But the time of order time is hard to predict thus it's also hard to make management decision on deliver or wait. In this Monte Carlo Simulation, we'd like to help the manager to make such decision.
- Scenario 1: One order is ready to be delivered and another order come in right now. In what condition of the locations of custmers we shoud wait and deliver these two together or deliver it right now and then come back for the other?
- Scenario 2: The restaurant would receive a fixed number of orders thorougout a day (8:00 am to 8:00 pm). How many delivery man should be employed to attain a trade-off between the cost of employemnt and the ratio of cancellation. (Customer would cancell the order within x minutes) 

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
- The location of delivery destination 
- Weather impact on traffic
- Traffic condition on roads

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
- The more far from resturant the new order is, the more likely to wait. 

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
